# What It Does #
This project was used to get an idea of how to structure SQL queries and how to use PHP to interface with a database. 

# What I Learned #
* Basics of SQL (element and table CRUD, sorting, joining, subqueries)
* Writing SQL DDL and data by hand ready for importing.
* Usage of mariaDB and PHPmyAdmin.
* Basics of PHP (variables, loops and conditionals, working with databases and displaying data, importing  files such as headers).

Uploading this project to github and my project site has also taught me how to ensure the site and database can still talk to each other through deployment. The original site used a custom php server program to run the site only on the local machine so I've had to learn how to replicate that remotely. I've also learned how to pull the connection details out from being inline into an ini file and secured those details with the .htaccess file, allowing an extra level of security.
