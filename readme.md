# What It Does #
This project was used to get an idea of how to structure SQL queries and how to use PHP to interface with a database. 

# What I Learned #
* Basics of SQL (Element and table CRUD, )
* Usage of mariaDB and PHPmyAdmin.
* Basics of PHP

Upon uploading to github and my project site, this has also taught me how to ensure the site and database can still talk to each other through deployment.
